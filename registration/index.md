Participation is free of charge, but we do ask all attendees to register beforehand. If you are not a member of VERSEN yet, please do consider to also become a member [here](https://www.versen.nl/users/new) after registering for the symposium. You are very welcome to the community at any time.

If you have registered and are not able to attend the event, please send an email to one of the following organizers to cancel the registration: Ayushi (a.rastogi \[at\] rug \[dot\] nl), Bin (bin.lin \[at\] ru \[dot\] nl), or Casper (c.b.poulsen \[at\] tudelft \[dot\] nl). This will help us better schedule the event. Thank you very much for the cooperation!
