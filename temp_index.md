The 9th Dutch national symposium on software engineering (SEN) will be held on Friday 2nd June 2023.
<!--After the success of the SEN Symposium of 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, we cordially invite
you to the seventh edition.-->
At this conference we bring together the Dutch software engineering community.
<br><br>

The symposium is organized by VERSEN, the <a href="https://www.versen.nl/">Dutch National Association
for Software Engineering</a>. The program will feature keynotes, invited
presentations, and contributed “lightning talks”.

<br><br>
We will offer talks by the following keynote and invited speakers:

        <b>Title:</b>
        <p>
            The Power of Feedback -- in a Cyber-Physical World
        </p>
        <b>Abstract:</b>
        <p>
            Feedback allows systems to seamlessly and instantaneously adapt their behavior to their environment and is thereby the fundamental principle of life and technology -- it lets animals breathe, it stabilizes the climate, it allows airplanes to fly, and the energy grid to operate. During the last century, control technology excelled at using this power of feedback to engineer extremely stable, robust, and reliable technological systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the ubiquity of computing devices in modern technological systems, feedback loops become cyber-physical -- the laws of physics governing technological, social or biological processes interact with (cyber) computing systems in a highly nontrivial manner, pushing towards higher and higher levels of autonomy and self-regulation. While reliability of these systems remains of utmost importance, a fundamental understanding of cyber-physical feedback loops for large-scale CPS is lacking far behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this talk I will discuss how a control-inspired view on formal methods for reliable software design enables us to utilize the power of feedback for robust and reliable self-adaptation in cyber-physical system design.<br><br>
