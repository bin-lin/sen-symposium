## Call for Lightning Talks

We invite all software engineering researchers in the Netherlands to
contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for
“lightning talks” - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated
between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.

There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be
aimed to the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may,
for instance:

* describe recently published results;
* present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle
them);
* summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation;
* recently granted (or started) research projects;
* motivate a "call to arms" for the broad VERSEN community.  

There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals
(PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium.

<!--
Please submit your one-page proposal (PDF) using EasyChair.
