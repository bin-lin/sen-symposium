The next annual Software Engineering Nederland (SEN) symposium will
take place on Friday, January 31st, 2020 at CWI in Amsterdam

The symposium is organized by VERSEN, the [Dutch National Association
for Software Engineering](https://www.versen.nl/). The program will
feature invited presentations, contributed “lightning talks” and will
include plenty of time for discussions and networking.

### Invited Speakers

* Wil van der Aalst (RWTH Aachen University, Germany)
* Vasilios Andrikopoulos (University of Groningen, The Netherlands)
* Dino Distefano (Facebook, UK)
* Veelasha Moonsamy (Radboud University, The Netherlands) 
* Alexandra Silva (University College London, UK)
* Jan van Zoest (Royal Philips, The Netherlands) 


### Call for Lightning Talks

We invite all software engineering researchers in the Netherlands to
contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for
“lightning talks” - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated
between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.

There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be
aimed to the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may,
for instance:

* describe recently published results; 
* present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle
them); 
* summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation; 
* recently granted (or started) research projects; 
* motivate a “call to arms” for the broad VERSEN community.  

There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals
(PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium. At
submission time, authors can indicate whether they would also like to
present a poster to complement their proposed talk.  Please submit
your one-page proposal (PDF) using EasyChair:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sensymposium2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sensymposium2020)

### Important Dates 

Submission of talk proposals: December 13

Notification: January 3, 2020 (or earlier) 

We look forward to seeing you at the SEN symposium!
