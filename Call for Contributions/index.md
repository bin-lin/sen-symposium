<!-- The SEN symposium invites all software engineering researchers in the -->
<!-- Netherlands to contribute to the program. Contributions can be in the -->
<!-- form of a poster and/or an “elevator pitch” presentation. Admission -->
<!-- will be based on the evaluation of one-page abstracts describing the -->
<!-- contribution. -->

<!-- ### Pitch Presentations: -->

<!-- The SEN Symposium offers researchers the opportunity to give a short -->
<!-- presentation of their work as an elevator pitch. The name “elevator -->
<!-- pitch” reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver a -->
<!-- summary of your work in the time span of an elevator ride, or -->
<!-- approximately thirty seconds to five minutes. We aim to accept high -->
<!-- quality short pitches by both junior researchers (PhD students and -->
<!-- postdocs; 3-6 minutes) and senior researchers (>postdoc; 5-8 minutes). -->

<!-- ### Posters: -->

<!-- Instead or in addition to pitch presentations, researchers can present -->
<!-- their work on posters that will be on display during the whole day. -->

<!-- ### Abstract Submission: -->

<!-- Please submit your pitch/poster proposal in one page (500 words max) -->
<!-- in PDF format. Proposals must include topic, novelty, and presenter -->
<!-- information (name, affiliation, short CV or link to web page with the -->
<!-- information, name of supervisor for PhD students). Please submit your -->
<!-- proposals to <a -->
<!-- href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sensym2019">SENSym2019 -->
<!-- on easyChair</a>. -->

<!-- ### Important Dates: -->
<!-- **Submission Deadline(extended)**: January 18, 2019, midnight CET -->

<!-- **Notification**: January 21, 2019 -->

We will be announcing a call for contributions in the fall of 2019.
