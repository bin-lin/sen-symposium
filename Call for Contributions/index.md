This call aims to attract high-class elevator pitches for SEN symposium. 

### Elevator Pitches   
  
The SEN Symposium offers young software engineering researchers the opportunity to give a short presentation of their work as an elevator pitch. 

The name 'elevator pitch' reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver a summary of your work in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to five minutes. We aim to accept high quality short pitches by young researchers (academic age 2-7, including all research years; pitch length should be a 3-6 minutes).
  
  
### Submission Guidelines    
  
Please submit your elevator pitch proposal in one page (500 words max) in PDF format. Proposals must include topic, presenter information (name, affiliation, PhD supervisor) together with a short CV, and novelty. Please submit your proposals at the following <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sensym2018">Easychair Submission Link</a>.
 
   
### Important Dates
