The next annual Software Engineering Nederland (SEN) symposium will 
take place in the afternoons (circa 13:00 - 17:30) of Thursday 18th 
and Friday 19th February 2021. 

The symposium is organized by VERSEN, the [Dutch National Association
for Software Engineering](https://www.versen.nl/). The program will
feature invited presentations and contributed “lightning talks”.

### Invited Speakers

* Barbora Buhnova (Masaryk University Brno)
* Yanja Dajsuren (Eindhoven University of Technology) 
* Emitza Guzman (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)
* Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen University)
* Dennis Komm (ETH Zürich)
* Burcu Kulahcioglu Ozkan (Delft University of Technology)
* Joost Visser (Leiden University)

### Call for Lightning Talks

We invite all software engineering researchers in the Netherlands to
contribute to the symposium program. We welcome proposals for
“lightning talks” - short but engaging presentations, to be allocated
between 5 and 10 minutes at the symposium.

There is no specific format for lightning talks. Still, they should be
aimed to the broad VERSEN audience. An exciting lightning talk may,
for instance:

* describe recently published results; 
* present open research problems (and/or ongoing efforts to tackle
them); 
* summarize a recently concluded PhD dissertation; 
* recently granted (or started) research projects; 
* motivate a “call to arms” for the broad VERSEN community.  

There will be a (lightweight) evaluation of one-page talk proposals
(PDF) describing the envisioned presentation at the symposium. 
<!-- At submission time, authors can indicate whether they would also like to
present a poster to complement their proposed talk. -->  
Please submit your one-page proposal (PDF) using EasyChair.

### Important Dates
