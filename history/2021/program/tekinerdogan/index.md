### Architecting Software-Intensive System-of-Systems
Whereas traditionally software systems were addressing a single domain, we can now observe the composition of multiple systems that are integrated in a coherent way, leading to software-intensive system-of-systems (SoSs). 
In an SoS, the individual system components have managerial and operational independence, are geographically distributed, have emergent behavior, and are characterized by a continuous need for evolution. These characteristics impose important challenges for the engineering of software-intensive SoSs that have not been resolved yet. 

In this presentation, I will mainly focus on the architecture design of software-intensive SoSs. Currently, the software architect has already of a broad knowledge on software architecture design to support the development of systems that meet the stakeholder needs. However, these approaches did not explicitly consider the scale of SoS and its' specific characteristics.

In this presentation, I will discuss the key concepts of SoSs, provide examples of SoSs in practice, present the key challenges for architecting SoSs, and discuss possible solutions directions for architecting software-intensive SoSs.
