**Title**\
Where Model-Based Testing Meets Software Engineering

**Abstract**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Model-based testing has been the promising next step in test-automation for a while now; and while it has been picked up as a software engineering practice, it is not applied at a large scale. On the other hand, Behaviour-Driven Development has become popular recently in software development. As part of this approach, scenarios describing a behaviour of the system are written in a structured natural language format. In my talk, I will present an approach where we translate these scenarios into a formal model, such that the test-automation techniques of model-based testing can be exploited.
