**Title**\
Software Engineering Education in the LLM Era: Promises, Perils, and Risks

**Abstract**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Large language models (LLMs) are radically changing everyday life, and anybody can leverage them for various tasks. Such tasks also include software development-related ones.  This has changed how software engineers conceive, implement, and evolve their software. Also, this has profoundly impacted software engineering research, making some of the previous achievements obsolete and forcing everybody to rethink what would have been valuable contributions in this context. What about software engineering education? In this talk, I will outline my experience in embedding AI-intensive tools in software engineering courses, highlighting the positive aspects, challenges and risks I learned from the feedback I received from my students.

**Bio**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Massimiliano Di Penta is a full professor at the University of Sannio, Italy. His research interests include software maintenance and evolution, software analytics, empirical software engineering, and artificial intelligence for software engineering. He is an author of over 320 papers that appeared in international journals, conferences, and workshops. His h-index is 67 (Scopus), and 91 (Google Scholar).  He has received several awards for his research and service, including a SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award (2004), six ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished paper awards, and five most influential paper awards. According to articles that appeared in the Journal of Systems and Software, he was considered the second-most productive expert researcher in the software engineering area for the period 2010-2017 and for the period 2017-2020. He serves and has served in the organizing and program committees of more than 120 conferences, including the three most important conferences in the research area of software engineering (ICSE, ESEC/FSE, and ASE). He has been program co-chair of ICSE 2023, ESEC/FSE 2021, ASE 2017 and other software engineering conferences. He is associate editor-in-chief of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, co-editor in chief of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Processes edited by Wiley, editorial board member of Empirical Software Engineering Journal edited by Springer. He has served the editorial board of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology and of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

**Title**\
From verified compilers to verified compilation

**Abstract**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Formally verifying software is expensive, but for software components on whose correctness all other software relies, such as operating systems and compilers, the effort can be worthwhile. Examples of this are the fully verified operating systems microkernel seL4, or on the compiler side, the CompCert and CakeML compilers. To be able to fully verify a compiler, however, we need full access to the source code, and both the language as well as the implementation have to be stable. An alternative, more light-weight approach is verified compilation: instead of proving that the compiler produces correct code for every input program, we can generate a machine checkable proof that the code for a specific program is correct. In this talk, I will discuss this approach, and show how this is used to verify the compilation of the Plutus compiler which compiles a subset of Haskell to low-level code deployed for smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.</div>

**Bio**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Gabriele Keller is the head of the software engineering division and the chair of the software technology group at Utrecht University. Her research interest include programming language technology, in particular for functional and embedded languages, software verification, as well as high-performance computing. She received her PhD degree in 1999 from the Technical University, Berlin, on the implementation of irregular data-parallelism. She worked at the University of New South Wales in Australia, where she co-founded the programming language group, and moved to Utrecht University in 2018.

**Title**\
Where Model-Based Testing Meets Software Engineering

**Abstract**
<div style="text-align: justify">
Model-based testing has been the promising next step in test-automation for a while now; and while it has been picked up as a software engineering practice, it is not applied at a large scale. On the other hand, Behaviour-Driven Development has become popular recently in software development. As part of this approach, scenarios describing a behaviour of the system are written in a structured natural language format. In my talk, I will present an approach where we translate these scenarios into a formal model, such that the test-automation techniques of model-based testing can be exploited.

**Title**\
Elevating Compiler Design: Abstractions for Effective Optimizations


**Abstract**
<div style="text-align: justify">
With applications becoming more complex and higher-level, we need compilers to keep up with these higher levels of complexity and abstractions.
This talk focuses on how different levels of abstraction in compiler intermediate representations (IRs) can improve optimization techniques. We’ll discuss how abstractions make it easier to understand and implement optimizations. In particular, how abstraction can turn global, effectful reasoning into local, pure reasoning. We also discuss how optimizing and exploring these large design spaces in compiler development, with a focus on the tradeoffs between automation and manual optimization.
